# FormulaOne Prediction System

## Overview

The FormulaOne Prediction System is an advanced machine learning project designed to predict the outcomes of Formula One races. By analyzing historical data and various influencing factors, the system provides predictions on race results, driver performance, and team standings.

## Features

- **Race Outcome Prediction:** Predict the winner of a Formula One race based on historical data and current season statistics.
- **Driver Performance Analysis:** Evaluate and forecast individual driver performance over the season.
- **Team Performance Insights:** Analyze and predict the performance of different teams throughout the season.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize predictions and performance metrics using graphs and charts.

## Installation

To set up the FormulaOne Prediction System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/formulaone-prediction-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd formulaone-prediction-system
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the System**

   Update the configuration file `config.json` with your data sources and other settings.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**

   Place your historical race data and other relevant datasets in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the Model**

   Run the training script to build the prediction model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**

   Use the prediction script to get results for upcoming races:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

4. **Visualize Results**

   Generate and view visualizations using:

   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```
